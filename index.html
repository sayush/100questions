            Civics (History and Government) Questions for the Naturalization

            <p>
              The 100 civics (history and government) questions and answers for
              the naturalization test are listed below. The civics test is an
              oral test and the USCIS Officer will ask the applicant up to 10 of
              the 100 civics questions. An applicant must answer 6 out of 10
              questions correctly to pass the civics portion of the
              naturalization test.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the naturalization test, some answers may change because of
              elections or appointments. As you study for the test, make sure
              that you know the most current answers to these questions. Answer
              these questions with the name of the official who is serving at
              the time of your eligibility interview with USCIS. The USCIS
              Officer will not accept an incorrect answer.
